    <h1>Welcome to My Site!</h1>
    <p> Here, you can find some of my assignments, some information about me, and overall a show of the skills that I have aquired throughout the class this semester. Please click throughout the site to find some of my assignments, my education, and some of the things that I worked hard on throughout the semester!	</p>
    <p>I am creating this site not only to test my skills in Dreamweaver, but also to create a space for me to upload other things during my college career. This site will be continuously updated and used like a portfolio to show off my work throughout my time at UNM. Please be patient as I upload more things, and please let me know through the contact page if anything is wrong with the site itself, as well as any questions.</p>
    <p>I am always open to ideas on how to better this site, as well as my skills in Dreamweaver itself. Please feel free to let me know if you have any suggestions on anything I've included!<br>
    </p>
    <p>Thank you for your interest!</p>
