    <h1>Education/Resume   </h1>
    <p>Hello everyone, here I have uploaded my resume, which includes my education. Because this is up on the internet, I have blanked out my personal information. Throughout the past semester, I have become way more comfortable with numerous platforms in the Adobe suite. This includes Dreamweaver, which I am using to create this website, as well as applications such as InDesign and Photoshop. With these skills, I have created a new, stylized resume in order to stand out among other applicants.</p>
    <p>In my application, you will see that along with my education, I have included areas that explore my work experience, some of my skills, references, and a contact area.</p>
    <p>The experience within this classroom has added numerous skills, such as Dreamweaver and Powerpoint. In other classes, I have also learned how to design in InDesign and Adobe Express.</p>
    <p>I am very grateful for my education, and take it very seriously. I was on the honor roll all four years of high school, and have made the dean's list at UNM.    </p>
