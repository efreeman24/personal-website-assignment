    <h1>Portfolio</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my portfolio! Here you will find some of the assignments I have created throughout this class, as well as their descriptions and my takeaways.    </p>
    <p><a href="Emily Freeman Video Assignment.mp4">Emily Freeman Video Assignment</a></p>
    <p>By clicking the link above, you will be transported to watch my video assignment. For this assignment, I focused on Meow Wolf in Santa Fe. I did this through finding images that went along with my narration, in order to tell the story of how Meow Wolf opened, and what their immersive experience entails. I did this assignment in Powerpoint, which I never really use. I am a mac user, so if I need to use something besides Google Slides, I use Keynote. I never knew that you could do narrations over videos in Powerpoint, so this project was fun!</p>
    <p><a href="https://emilysmovieopinion.wordpress.com/">Wordpress Blog</a></p>
    <p>Click the above link to access my Wordpress blog. Throughout the semester, I have reviewed movies that I've watched each week. These range from horror to drama (I usually watch movies depending on the season, hence why all of October was dedicated to horror.) I really enjoy watching movies, but am not super critical of them, so I thought doing this for my blog assignment would be fun and different than what I would usually do. I also usually hate actual movie critic sites because they tend to me overwhelming, and focus on things that I usually don't care about. So, I created my own!</p>
    <p><a href="assignment 4.html">Basic Webpage</a></p>
    <p>Click the above link to access a basic webpage that I created for this class using Dreamweaver. Before this semester, I would have never even tried to create a website from code on my own. I was really intimidated by this course at first, just because I tend to avoid stuff like this that is outside of my comfort zone. However, although this example doesn't have any real content on it, it shows that I did eventually figure out how to get some basic stuff on a page, which is a pretty big feat considering most people go their entire lives without ever learning anything about HTML.</p>
    <p>Thank you for taking the time to look through some of the assignments and skills that I have learned throughout the semester!</p>
